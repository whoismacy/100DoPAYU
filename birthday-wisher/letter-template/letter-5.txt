Dearest [NAME],

On your birthday, I want you to know how much you mean to the world. You are not just another year older, but another year more incredible, more wise, and more amazing.

Your strength, kindness, and spirit continue to inspire those around you. May this year bring you closer to your dreams, fill your heart with joy, and remind you of how truly remarkable you are.

Wishing you a year of growth, love, and endless possibilities.

With deepest affection,
